# vfsgen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shurcooL/vfsgen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shurcooL/vfsgen) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen)

Package vfsgen generates a vfsdata.go file that statically implements the given virtual filesystem.

vfsgen is simple and minimalistic. You provide an input filesystem, and it generates an output .go file.

Features:

-	Efficient generated code without unneccessary overhead.

-	Uses gzip compression internally (selectively, only for files that compress well).

-	Enables direct access to internal gzip compressed bytes via an optional interface.

-	Outputs `gofmt`ed Go code.

Installation
------------

```bash
go get -u github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen
```

Usage
-----

This code will generate an assets_vfsdata.go file with `var assets http.FileSystem = ...` that statically implements the contents of "assets" directory.

```Go
var fs http.FileSystem = http.Dir("assets")

err := vfsgen.Generate(fs, vfsgen.Options{})
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln(err)
}
```

Then, in your program, you can use `assets` as any other [`http.FileSystem`](https://godoc.org/net/http#FileSystem), for example:

```Go
file, err := assets.Open("/some/file.txt")
if err != nil { ... }
defer file.Close()
```

```Go
http.Handle("/assets/", http.FileServer(assets))
```

### `go generate` Usage

vfsgen is great to use with go generate directives. The code above can go in an assets_gen.go file, which can then be invoked via "//go:generate go run assets_gen.go". The input virtual filesystem can read directly from disk, or it can be more involved.

By using build tags, you can create a development mode where assets are loaded directly from disk via `http.Dir`, but then statically implemented for final releases.

See [shurcooL/Go-Package-Store#38](https://github.com/shurcooL/Go-Package-Store/pull/38) for a complete example of such use.

### Additional Embedded Information

All compressed files implement `vfsgen.GzipByter` for efficient direct access to the internal compressed bytes:

```Go
// GzipByter is implemented by compressed files for
// efficient direct access to the internal compressed bytes.
type GzipByter interface {
	// GzipBytes returns gzip compressed contents of the file.
	GzipBytes() []byte
}
```

Files that have been determined to not be worth gzip compressing (their compressed size is larger than original) implement `vfsgen.NotWorthGzipCompressing`:

```Go
type NotWorthGzipCompressing interface {
	// NotWorthGzipCompressing indicates the file is not worth gzip compressing.
	NotWorthGzipCompressing()
}
```
